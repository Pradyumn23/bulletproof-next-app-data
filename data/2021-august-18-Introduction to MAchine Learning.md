Artifical Inteeligence can be defined as Engineering and science of making Intelligent machines.(JOhn Mcarthy). Machine learning, a sub branch of AI, can best be described in the words of Arthur Samuel: A computer program is said to lrarn from experience E with respect to task T and performnce measure P if its measure of performance at task T , as measure by P, improves with the experience of E.

There are two broad types of Machine Learning.
Supervised Learning: Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.
In the sense, that through the example data the algorith will learn to map inputs to a outputs
Unsupervised learning:Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the algorithm is not provided with any pre-assigned labels or scores for the training data. As a result, unsupervised learning algorithms must first self-discover any naturally occurring patterns in that training data set
