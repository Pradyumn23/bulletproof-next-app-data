The rise of JavaScript ,to power the web, in the mid 2000s was so fast that everyday devices like cell phones and PCs could not keep up. OLD devices started giving up. There was a huge load time as there was so much javaScript to parse. Frameworks like React were sending huge javascript bundles to render simple static HTML pages. Developers who moved from PHP soon realized the mistake they had made. Sure React was great for interactivity and powerful ,but using that to build everything created the problem. Browsers had to work hard. Search Engines had a hard time finding what your page was about as they couldn't find what your page was about. React Framework tried to fix it with their server side rendering. In All fairness,it offered the best of both worlds. The developers  got a chance to code in his preferred framework, and the client got little to no hydrated JS. But this was too difficult to implement. Proper caching and implementing this whole architecture was too cumbersomeâ€¦ NextJs comes the rescue. It has100% react support , Caching and Automatic Static Optimization built-in, and much more. The Biggest Advantage is that it is very easy to support. Additionally next js is getting huge updates and its user base is increasing by the second. As the demand for react developers is huge, learning Next.js is surely a wonderful skill to have for powerful web applications
